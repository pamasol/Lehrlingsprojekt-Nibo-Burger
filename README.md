# NIBO Burger – Pamasol Electronic project for apprentices

[Pamasol Willi Mäder AG](https://www.pamasol.com/) has specialised in the development and production of solutions for aerosols and spray systems since 1965. 

Its Automatiker (German for “mechatronic apprentices”) go through a 4-year apprenticeship. They get an on the job training by qualified Pamasol employees and go to college one or two days per week.

At Pamasol they work on customer projects as well as on internal training projects. NIBO Burger represents the internal electronic training project. It pursues the following goals:

* Improving soldering skills
* Getting familiar with PCBs and electronic components (diode, LED, transistor, capacitor, amplifier, [microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino_Uno))
* Acquiring knowledge of integrated circuits (motor bridges, [odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry), USB programmer)
* Learning microcontroller programming with C and C++
* Using Git as software version control system and GitHub for collaborative software development
* Enhancing documentation and presentation skills

# Robot construction kit NIBO burger
The NIBO burger robot kit is a free programmable robot that can act autonomously with its environment. It is equipped with an Atmel ATmega16 AVR main controller, 9 sensors and a slot for ARDUINO shields where for example an 8x8 LED matrix display can be mounted. It comes as an assembly kit that is provided by [nicai-systems](http://www.nicai-systems.com/), Germany.
