# NIBO Burger – Pamasol Electronic project for apprentices

[Pamasol Willi Mäder AG](https://www.pamasol.com/) has specialised in the development and production of solutions for aerosols and spray systems since 1965. 

Its Automatiker (German for “mechatronic apprentices”) go through a 4-year apprenticeship. They get an on the job training by qualified Pamasol employees and go to college one or two days per week.

At Pamasol they work on customer projects as well on internal training projects. NIBO Burger represents the internal electronic project. It pursues the following goals:

* Improving soldering skills
* Getting familiar with PCBs and electronic components (diode, LED, transistor, capacitor, amplifier, microcontroller)
* Acquiring knowledge of integrated circuits (motor bridges, odometry, USB programmer)
* Learning microcontroller programming with C and C++
* Using Git as software version control system and GitHub for collaborative software development
* Enhancing documentation and presentation skills
